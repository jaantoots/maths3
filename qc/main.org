#+TITLE: Quantum Computation

* Significance and context
** Fundamental connection between physics and computing
*** Physics as computing
*** Computing as physics
** Technology/engineering
*** Miniaturisation of computer components to subatomic scale
*** Much recent progress in quantum technology
Expect around 50 qubits in full coherent control soon
** Theoretical quantum computer science, quantum algorithms
*** How to actually exploit quantum physical effects for computational possibilities beyond classical
* Basic ingredients of computational complexity theory
** Computability vs uncomputability
*Example*:
- given integer $N$, is it prime? /computable/
- halting problem: given the code of a computer program, will it halt if run? /uncomputable/
- given a polynomial with integer coefficients with many variables, does it have a root in integers? /uncomputable/
These are for classical computing
All laws of quantum physics (state descriptions, evolution equations) are all computable on a classical computer,
so QC (being a quantum process) cannot compute any classically uncomputable problems
But complexity of the computation 
** Computational task
- Input :: bit string $x = i_1\dots i_n$
- Language :: $L \subset B$
- Decision problem :: given an $n$-bit string is it in the language
- Output :: ?
** Computational model
*** Process with dicrete steps, computational steps
** Randomised (probabilistic) computation
Process has access to random bits
** Complexity of a computational task (or algorithm)
Consumption of resource as function of input size $n$.
Resources usually:
time $T(n) \equiv$ number of copmutational steps needed,
space $Sp(n) \equiv$ amount of memory/work space needed,
in each case take worst case of input size $n$.
*Main question*: Does $T$ grow polynomially or exponentially (super-poly) with $n$?
- Poly :: $T(n) = O(poly(n))$ or $O(N^k)$ some $k$, i.e. $\exists n_0, \text{const} c | T(n) < cn^k$ all $n>n_0$
- Exponential :: $T(n) = c_12^{c_2 n}$ all $n>n_0$, also $T(n)  =2^{\sqrt{n}},n^{\log n}$ super-poly & sub-exponential
